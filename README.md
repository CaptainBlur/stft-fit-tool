# stft-fit-tool
Simple and yet unfinished spectrum analyzer
# What is it all about?
Very useful tool to pick up the best configuration for your nifty spectrum-analyzer utility (or whatever you trying to develop). It chews your input .wav file and gives your two options for CSV or handy plotted graphs in time and frequency domains, as output.
# What it can do?
- Simple and friendly console interface
- Able to read launch arguments and change parameters on the fly (if you even dare to build it)
- Support all cosine-like windows (cuz I'm too dumb in math to add more complicated ones)
- Handle only 1ch audio file(s)
